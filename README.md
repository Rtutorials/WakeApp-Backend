# WakeApp (Backend)

For the ITC transportation hackathon we built WakeApp: It detects if a driver has fallen asleep at the wheel and wakes them up. We won first prize! ðŸ¥‡

Take a look at our presentation video!

The idea is that your phone camera takes repeated fast pictures and detects eye locations and if the eyes are closed using a CNN. If eyes are confidently determined to be closed for a few seconds a wake up sound is played- If you have any questions or ideas on how to use or improve this technology, do shoot a message
