# WakeApp (Backend)

For the ITC transportation hackathon we built WakeApp: It detects if a driver has fallen asleep at the wheel and wakes them up. We won first prize! ðŸ¥‡

Take a look at our presentation <a href=https://youtu.be/fTslVKN8JVU>Video!</a>

The idea is that your phone camera takes repeated fast pictures and detects eye locations and if the eyes are closed using a CNN. If eyes are confidently determined to be closed for a few seconds a wake up sound is played- If you have any questions or ideas on how to use or improve this technology, do shoot a message.

The images were trained on 57,000 eye images, half open half closed. The data can be found at http://mrl.cs.vsb.cz/eyedataset. The first task is eye detection, which was achieved using a haar cascade (90% accuracy). The second task was cropping the image to just the frame of the eyes and adjusting for bright/dark images. The third task was labeling eyes as open/closed (98% accuracy). Putting it all together is a NodeJS frontend which accesses a camera pointed at the user and takes a photo multiple times a second and sends it to a flask server running this code. If eyes are consistently not detected as open for several seconds in a row, a loud sound is played to the user.
